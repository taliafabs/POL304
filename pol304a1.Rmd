The code and data associated with the completion of this assignment can be accessed via my GitHub repository. The assignment was completed using R Programming Language and the tidyverse, janitor and dplyr for sub-setting data, and knitr for the tables. The analysis is based on the research paper titled "Does Indiscriminate Violence Incite Insurgent Attacks? Evidence from Chechnya"

## load the data
chechen_data <- read_csv("chechen.csv")

# time-varying confounder is controlled, as only 90 days before and after shelling are observed

## a sample from the data

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
